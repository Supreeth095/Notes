* Representaions of Graphs
- 2 standard ways to represent a graph G = (V, E)
  + collection of adjacency lists: 
    compact way to represent sparse graphs E is much less than V^2
    desirable property: amount of memory it requires is O(V+E)
  + an adjacency matrix
    preferred when graph is dense, E is close to V^2
    when we need to tell quickly if there is an edge connecting 2 given vertices


- adjacency matrix: 
  + Let A be adjacency matrix which represents G, we have A^2 counts 2 steps 
    paths from i to any node j
