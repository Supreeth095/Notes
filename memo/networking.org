* I/O Multiplexing
** I/O Models
    - blocking I/O
    - nonblocking I/O
    - I/O multiplexing (select and poll)
    - signal driven I/O (SIGIO)
    - asynchronous I/O (the POSIX asio_ functions)
    - 2 phases for an input operation:
      + waiting for the data to be ready
      + copying the data from the kernel to the process

** select function
   SYNOPSIS:
   #include <sys/select.h>
   #include <sys/time.h>
   int select(int maxfdp1, fd_set *readset, fd_set *writeset, fd_set 
   *exceptset, const struct timeval *timeout);
    
   struct timeval {
        long tv_sec;    // seconds
        long tv_usec;   // microseconds
   };

*** 3 posibilities 
    :Important
    - Wait forever: return only when one of the specified descriptors is ready 
      for I/O. For this, we specify the /timeout/ argument as a null pointer.
    - Wait up to a fixed amount of time: return when one of the specified 
      descriptor is ready for I/O, but do not wait beyond the number of 
      seconds and microseconds specfied in the /timeval/ structure pointed to 
      by the /timeout/ argument
    - Do not wait at all - Return immediately after checking the descriptor. 
      This is called /polling/. To specify this, the /timeout/ argument must 
      point to a /timeval/ structure and the time value must be 0

    - the actual resolution supported by the kernel is more coarse (Unix 
      kernels: 10ms). There's also a scheduling latency involved, meaning it 
      takes some time after the timer expires before the kernel schedules this 
      process to run.

*** Under what conditions is a descriptor ready?
    1. A socket is ready for reading
       - The number of bytes of data in the socket receive buffer is greater 
         than or equal to the current size of the low-water mark for the 
         socket receive buffer. Set low-water mark using the *SO_RCVLOWAT* 
         socket option. It defaults to 1 for TCP and UDP sockets.
       - The read half of the connectoin is closed (TCP receive FIN). A read 
         operation on the socket will not block and will return 0
       - The socket is a listening socket and the number of completed 
         connections is nonzero.
       - A socket error is pending. A read operation on the socket will not 
         block and will return an error(-1) with errno set to the specific 
         error condition. These pending errors can also be fetched and cleared 
         by calling *getsockopt* and specifying the *SO_ERROR* socket option.
    2. A socket is ready for writing
       - The number of bytes of available space in the socket send buffer is 
         greater than or equal to the current size of the low-water mark for 
         the socket send buffer and either
         + the socket is connected
         + the socket doesn't require a connection
         Set low-water mark = *SO_SNDLOWAT*. This low-water mark normally 
         defaults to 2048 for TCP and UDP sockets.
       - the write half of the connection is closed. A write operation on the 
         socket will generate *SIGPIPE*
       - a socket using a non-blocking *connect* has completed the connection, 
         or the *connect* failed.
       - A socket error is pending. A write operation on the socket will not 
         block and will return an error (-1) with *errno* set to the specific 
         error condition. These *pending errors* can also be fetched and 
         cleared by calling *getsockopt* with the *SO_ERROR* socket option.
    3. A socket has an exception condition pending if there is out-of-band 
       data for the socket or the socket is still at the out-of-band mark.

| Read half of the connection closed        | ●         |           |            |

| TCP out-of-band data                      |           |           | ●          |
