* Introduction
** Supervised Learning
- give dataset and "right answers" -> produce more right answers
- *Regression*: produce continuous valued output
  ex: housing price
- *Classification*: 
  ex: breast cancer predicts

** Unsupervised Learning
- given a dataset, can you find some structure in the data
- unsupervised learning algorithm is expected to separate data in groups
  ex: google news, genes understanding problems
- application: 
  + organize computing clusters
  + social network analysis
  + market segmentation
  + astronomical data analysis

- Cocktail party problem


* Linear regression with one variable
** Model Representation
- Notation
  m: number of training examples
  x: input variable / features
  y: output variable / target variable
- h: hypothesis. size of house -> h -> estimated value of y
  h: map from x's to y's
- h(x) = a0 + a1*x
  + Linear regression with one variable
  + univariate linear regression

** Cost function
- how to choose parameters a0, a1?
- Idea: choose h so that h(x) is close to y for our training examples (x,y)
  cost function: J(a0, a1) = 1/2m * sum(1, m, h(xi) - yi^2)
  we need to minimize J
